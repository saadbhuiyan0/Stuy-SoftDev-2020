d3js.org

- declarative approach operating on arbitrary sets of nodes called selections instead of an imperative approach and manual iteration
- computed properties = bound data
- transform/manipulate what is there instead of making something new
- enter and exit selections, you can create new nodes for incoming data and remove outgoing nodes that are no longer needed
- "D3 lets you transform documents based on data; this includes both creating and destroying elements. D3 allows you to change an existing document in response to user interaction, animation over time, or even asynchronous notification from a third-party. A hybrid approach is even possible, where the document is initially rendered on the server, and updated on the client via D3."


Let's make a bar chart

- selection.node returns the element
- selection.join can enter, update, and exit data
- join() uses default logic for entering, updating, and exiting data.
- scaleLinear() can be used to scale graphs


Learn D3: By Example

- Observable has an extensive gallery that can showcase features and provide templates for projects in D3.
- Observable javascript supports a with clause for import statements.
- Observable dataflow updates data live, making dynamic visualizations easy.
- Customizable and easily manipulated. Not working as objects that are created and act immutable.
