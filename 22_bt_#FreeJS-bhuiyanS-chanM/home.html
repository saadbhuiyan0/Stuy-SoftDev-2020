			<h1>Bootstrap</h1>
			<p>Bootstrap is a front-end framework for web development created at Twitter that later became open-source. It's a very popular framework utilized by sites such as NBA.com, Walmart.com, Target.com, and Bloomberg.com.</p>
			<p>Bootstrap includes plenty of HTML and CSS based design templates for a variety of uses. It's great because it's pretty easy to learn, it allows for responsive web design, and it's compatible with a wide range of browsers. You can use Bootstrap to change the way elements on your page look or add completely new elements like forms, buttons, tables, navigation, etc. The list goes on.</p>
			<h3>BootstrapCDN</h3>
			<p>CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. You don't need to understand how that works but essentially it delivers web content to you (the end user). BootstrapCDN is the recommended CDN for Bootstrap. It's a public CDN that can load CSS, JavaScript and images remotely, from its servers. It's servers are very reliable and handle huge loads of traffic delivering more than 70 billion requests a month!</p>

		<div id="Getting Started">
			<h1>Getting Started with Bootstrap</h1>
			<p>To use Bootstrap's compiled CSS, we are going to use the BootstrapCDN. To do so, we have to include this line of code in the head of the HTML file (HTML5 doctype is required):<br><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;</code></p>
			<p>
		</div>
		<hr>
		<div id="Navigation Bar">
            <h1>Navigation Bar</h1>
            <p>That dark gray bar that always sticks to the top of your screen is this is the navigation bar. We made it so that it is always there on your screen but that's just one of many customization options. You can change the colors, the links, the brand, the logo, etc. You can even add a dropdown menu to it or a form like a search bar.</p>
        </div>
		<hr>
        <div id="Jumbotron" class="jumbotron text-center">
            <h1>This is a Jumbotron</h1>
			<h5>(like the first blue box)</h5>
			<br>
            <p>It's basically a large box that you can put stuff in. It's a nice way to isolate and call attention to something (ex: welcoming users of a website)	. It is not limited to a gray box, it can be anything from a color to an image to a video.</p>
			<p>To create a jumbotron you use a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element with class <code>.jumbotron</code>. 
			<p><small>P.S. You can add code elements like the ones in the last line with the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag.</small></p>
        </div>

		<div id="More">
            <h1>More cool things you can do with Bootstrap</h1>
			<h3>... with JavaScript. </h3>
            <p>Buttons, drop downs, forms, etc.</p>
