        <p>Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't.
          My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously
          or unconsciously. That's to be expected. I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text. Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT!</p>

        <p>It’s about making placeholder text great again. That’s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great again. All of the words in Lorem
          Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my
          words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. I’m the best thing that ever happened to
          placeholder text. The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!</p>
